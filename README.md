🖖 greetings githublings, this is spunx here, no.1 inalienator and general skeptic of this earthly world
👀 what you'll find here is a collection of projects id like to share with the world - sometimes visual, sometimes written, sometimes something else..
🌱 at the moment i'm working on building a multi-feature blog that forces me to communicate my thoughts instead of supressing them and letting them go, turning into nothing
💞️ hmu if you'd like to collaborate on absolutely anything out there, in the box or totally strange!!!
🫶 find me at @fourthestatecitizen on ig & inaliennation@gmail.com
